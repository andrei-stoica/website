Welcome to Code Corner!
=======================
Welcome to my website/blog. Going forward this will serve as a outlet for me to
document and share my experiences as I explore the intricate world of computer
science. I will be updating the blog portion of this site as I discover new
interesting technologies. 

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science, supervised by 
[Dr Ken Pu](http://db.science.uoit.ca/). My work will focus on automatic topic
discovery and understanding of text data. This will provide a large part of
the posts made here in the future.

This site also host my resume and links to my profiles on other platforms.

Stay tuned for more,
<br>Andrei
