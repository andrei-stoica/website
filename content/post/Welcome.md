Welcome to Code Corner!
=======================
Welcome to my website/blog. Going forward this will serve as a outlet for me to
document and share my experiences as I explore the intricate world of computer
science. I will be updating the blog portion of this site as I discover new
interesting technologies. 

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science, supervised by 
[Dr Ken Pu](http://db.science.uoit.ca/). My work focuses on text mining and
natural language processing queries in relational databases.

This site also host my resume and links to my profiles on other platforms.

Stay tuned for more,
<br>Andrei
